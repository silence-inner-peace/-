This course is an introduction to MPI in C/C++.

Message Passing Interface is a standardized and portable message passing interface allowing multiple process distributed over one or more machines to communicate. MPI is one of the fundamental bricks of high performance computing.

The course presents the fundamentals of MPI in C/C++. We will be using the C implementation of MPI (C++ pure MPI implementation has been given up in the standard since MPI-2.2

- Requirements

It is recommended that you already know a bit of C/C++. The examples will be given in C++ and the exercises will be compiled with g++ so that you can use C or C++.

Please note that C and C++ are not the only languages that can be used to do distributed computing with MPI. Most notably, every MPI implementation is also compatible with Fortran. On top of that, lots of interpreted languages have libraries allowing their developers to use mpi in an indirect way. For instance, Python users can use the library mpi4py.

- What will I learn?

You will learn what distributed programming is and what it's not. We will see examples of use of MPI in the high performance computing world and how MPI is used by scientists to compute simulations on the biggest clusters on Earth. After seeing such examples, we will dive in practice and will discover the fundamentals of MPI and how to make different process communicate.

- Difficulty

This course is aimed at medium programmers. You are required to know the basics of C/C++ and algorithmics : loops, conditionals, and I/Os.

- Hardware and Software requirements

To use MPI on your own computer, you will need an implementation of MPI. The most straightforward is OpenMPI which is free, open-source and packaged for most linux distributions, and also for Windows (using Cygwin).

Other than that, nothing specific is required since MPI is completely disconnected from the hardware.
