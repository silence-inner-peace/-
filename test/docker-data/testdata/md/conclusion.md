## General conclusion

This is it ! You have reached the end of this introduction on MPI. Hopefully you now know how to create a multi-process program, make all of your process talk in different ways, create communicators and custom datatypes and you are ready to build fully parallel applications.

As stated in the introduction, this is a perpetual work in progress so feel free to leave feedback so the contents of the course can be updated and improved. If you are interested in contributing, feel also free to fork the course [repository](https://github.com/mdelorme/Introduction-to-MPI-Tech-io-Playground) and propose pull requests be it for mere type correction, rephrasing to new chapters if you feel something is really missing !

Thank you for following this course, and we hope you liked it as much as we liked writing it.
