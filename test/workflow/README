[] Workflow scenario
This is a data processing flow:

datagen: no input. output 10 date files, each has 1000 lines, each line is a random number (using $RANDOM)

datamax: input is one data file. output the max number in that file as an output file

max: input is 10 files, each containing a number that is the max of a data file. output is the max of the 10 max numbers.

check: it watches how many datamax failed and reports success/fail stat

fail rate: 1/3

you can fix the location of input/output directory and/or input/output file name pattern for separate processes to read correct input
